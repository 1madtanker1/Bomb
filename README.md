Network Exploitation toolkit is a hackers special toolkit for network related attacks. These include: Port scanning, vulnerability scanning, Dos/DDos attacks, Wifi scanning and wifi deauthentication.

I started working on this project in December 2021, and so far I have added a Port Scanner, Dos/DDos, and wifi scanning/deauthentication modules of this toolkit. 

If you want to use this toolkit in a video or for a hacking project you are more then welcome too. However, if you comitt a crime using my software, I am not responsible for any civil or criminal charges resulting from the crime.
