Bomb is a hackers special tool for networking. it allows a hacker to scan the ports of a device, scan a device for vulnerabilities, execute a DOS attack on a wifi network, and much more.
I also added a larger description of bomb in the credits.txt file. As of right now, I have not added all of the different abilities in Bomb, there is just a port scanner, a wifi scanner
and an nmap scanner as of 12/31.
